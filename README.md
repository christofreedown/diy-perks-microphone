This is the Kicad implementation of a pc board for the DIY PERKS high performance microphone
Please become a subscriber to DIY PERKS channel on Youtube.
I have put this circuit into KICAD for those interested in putting it on a PC board.
I have not tested the board out yet.
The connection to the Volume control is a switch selecting one of 560 Ohm, 270 Ohm, 150 Ohm, 82 Ohm,
56 Ohm, 27 Ohm, 18 Ohm, 15 Ohm, 11 Ohm, 9.1 Ohm and 5.1 Ohm.
The microphone connection is to a 2N4416 Fet soldered directly to the outputs of the microphone cell.
The microphone capsule is a JLI2555.  I have included a .dxf file of the capsule case that has holes for the
sound.  It can be used to have the case made at an online laser cutting service.
